## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with Flexbox and Grid
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Interactive functionality and calculations
- **Google Fonts** - Poppins font family for clean typography
- **Netlify** - Deployment and hosting

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Navy Blue Gradient Background** (`#1B2A49` to `#314675`)
- **Coral-Orange Button Gradient** (`#FF6C51` to `#FF835E`)
- **Responsive Typography** - Scales beautifully across all device sizes
- **Smooth Animations** - Subtle hover effects and transitions
- **Mobile-First Design** - Optimized for touch interfaces

## 🧮 How It Works

1. **Enter Classes Attended** - Input the number of classes you've attended
2. **Enter Total Classes Held** - Input the total number of classes conducted
3. **Enter Required Attendance %** - Set your institution's minimum attendance requirement
4. **Get Results** - See your current attendance and how many classes you need to attend

### Calculation Formula

```javascript
// Current Attendance Percentage
attendancePercent = (attended / total) * 100

// Classes Needed to Meet Requirement
neededClasses = Math.ceil(((requiredPercent / 100) * total - attended) / (1 - requiredPercent / 100))
```
